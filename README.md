# Music Visualiser Project

Name: Alan Murphy

Student Number: C19717889

## Instructions
- Fork this repository and use it a starter project for your assignment
- Create a new package named your student number and put all your code in this package.
- You should start by creating a subclass of ie.tudublin.Visual
- There is an example visualiser called MyVisual in the example package
- Check out the WaveForm and AudioBandsVisual for examples of how to call the Processing functions from other classes that are not subclasses of PApplet

# Description of the assignment
The objective of this assignment was to make visuals that can be enjoyed while listening to music. For the music I created a track with a fellow student Andrew Murphy. The process was I created the drum pattern and bass line, then Andrew created the chords and melody and we kept bouncing the project back to one another until we were happy with the final production. The track is laoded when the spacebar is pressed and the first visual is displayed. All of the visuals make use of the frequency bands. Although the visiuals are pretty basic the end result is pretty good.

# Instructions
Once the progam compiles a new screen will appear with the starting visual. Press spacebar to start. The visuals within the program can be selected from pressing 1 to 9 on the numerical keypad. Press escape to exit.

# How it works
To run the program, press F5. A new window will appear with the first visual. Press spacebar and the music and visual will be begin. Select a visual by pressing 1 to 9. To close the cisuals, press escape.

# What I am most proud of in the assignment
I am proud of the track that I made with Andrew and the creative process of collaborating with someone remotely, that was fun. I'm also proud of being able the get each visual to display via a switch case. Initially, I had everythin in one file and used a switch case there also but now the code is much more cleaner. I also really enjoyed being able to toggle between visuals to create a sequence and very much brought me back to my lighting operator days in The Twisted Pepper using a DMX mixer.
